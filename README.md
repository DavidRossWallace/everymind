In Memory property graph database and database manager.

Everymind includes interface and tools to create all necessary schemas, libraries, mindsets, updates, serialization, re-ification and many other graph management functions.

everyMind includes a dynamic form interface for interacting with data, as well as a JSON level editor that allows for graph objects to be edited at the JSON level.

Supports both schema and schema-less graphs as well as dynamic or value based uids. Also supports a variety of indexing options as well as custom, abstact indexes and labelled sets.

*** Dynamic Machine Learning Models ***
One of the core goals behind everyMind was to make a database that can learn from the data (wisdeom) and index the learning in a way that could be shared with other everyMinds.
What resulted was a feature that essentially "machine learns" the graphs and generates feature indexes that can be used for prediction.
Everymind automates the task of creating prediction models - and can predict any or all featues wihtin any graph. Functions are included for various prediction tasks like filling in missing data, generating properties, abstract rankings, and prediction using queries (or classes) as input, which is helpfull for ebending and various generalized and abstracted experiments.
